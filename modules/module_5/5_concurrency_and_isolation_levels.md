# Lesson 5: Concurrency and Isolation Levels

## Learning Objectives
- Learn how multiple users access databases simultaneously.
- Understand potential issues (dirty reads, lost updates).
- Explore isolation levels and their trade-offs.

## Explanation
When multiple users query or modify data at the same time, conflicts can occur. Isolation levels define how transactions interact:
- Read Uncommitted: fastest but allows dirty reads.
- Read Committed: prevents dirty reads.
- Repeatable Read: prevents non-repeatable reads.
- Serializable: highest safety, but slower.

## Example
```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
```

## Practice Questions
1. What is a dirty read?
2. Which isolation level provides the highest consistency?

## Key Takeaways
Isolation levels balance consistency with performance; the right choice depends on the systemâ€™s needs.
