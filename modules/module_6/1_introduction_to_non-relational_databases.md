# Lesson 1: Introduction to Non-Relational Databases

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what NoSQL means.
- Learn why NoSQL databases emerged.
- Recognize differences from relational databases.

## Explanation
**NoSQL (Not Only SQL)** databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike relational databases, they don’t rely strictly on tables and rows. They often provide more flexibility and scalability at the cost of strict consistency.

## Example
- **Relational DB:** Tables for Students, Courses, Enrollments.
- **NoSQL DB:** JSON documents storing all student information, including courses inside the same record.

## Practice Questions
1. What does “NoSQL” stand for?
2. How do NoSQL databases differ from relational databases?

## Key Takeaways
NoSQL databases are more flexible with unstructured data and scale well, making them popular in modern applications.
