# Lesson 2: Types of NoSQL Databases

## Learning Objectives
- Identify the main types of NoSQL databases.
- Match use cases to database types.
- Understand trade-offs for each type.

## Explanation
Types of NoSQL databases:
- **Key–Value Stores:** Simple lookup by key (e.g., Redis).
- **Document Stores:** JSON-like documents (e.g., MongoDB).
- **Column Stores:** Optimized for analytics with wide tables (e.g., Cassandra).
- **Graph Databases:** Designed for relationships (e.g., Neo4j).

## Example
- Social media app → Graph DB.
- E-commerce catalog → Document DB.
- Caching user sessions → Key–Value store.

## Practice Questions
1. Which type of NoSQL database would you use for a recommendation system?
2. Match MongoDB, Redis, and Neo4j to their database types.

## Key Takeaways
Different NoSQL databases solve different problems; choosing the right type depends on the application.
