# Lesson 3: When to Use NoSQL vs. Relational Databases

## Learning Objectives
- Decide between relational and NoSQL databases.
- Recognize strengths and weaknesses of each.
- Apply decision-making to scenarios.

## Explanation
- **Relational:** Best for structured, consistent data with strong relationships (e.g., banking).
- **NoSQL:** Best for high scalability, flexible data, or when relationships are less important (e.g., social media feeds).

## Example
Bank transactions → relational DB (strict consistency).  
Real-time chat messages → NoSQL DB (speed + flexibility).

## Practice Questions
1. Why are relational databases preferred in banking?
2. Which database type would you use for IoT sensor data and why?

## Key Takeaways
Relational DBs ensure consistency and reliability; NoSQL DBs provide flexibility and scalability.
