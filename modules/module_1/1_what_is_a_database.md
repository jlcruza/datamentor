# Lesson 1: What Is a Database?

## Learning Objectives
- Define what a database is and why it is used.
- Distinguish between traditional file storage and database systems.
- Recognize examples of databases in daily life.

## Explanation
A database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. Unlike simple file storage, databases allow efficient querying, updating, and managing of information. They are managed by specialized software known as Database Management Systems (DBMS).

Databases are everywhere: in banking systems, online shopping, hospital records, and even in mobile apps you use daily. They make it possible to handle large amounts of information quickly and reliably.

## Examples
- Social media apps use databases to store user profiles, posts, and messages.
- E-commerce platforms use databases to track products, orders, and payments.

## Practice Questions
1. Give three real-world examples of systems that use databases.
2. What advantages does a database provide over a simple text file?
3. Which of your daily apps rely on a database?

## Key Takeaways
Databases store and manage structured information more efficiently than traditional files. They are the backbone of nearly all modern applications.
