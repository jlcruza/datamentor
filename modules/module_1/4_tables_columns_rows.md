# Lesson 4: Tables, Columns, and Rows: The Core Structure

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the structure of tables in relational databases.
- Differentiate between columns (attributes) and rows (records).
- Recognize how data is organized in a table.

## Explanation
In relational databases, data is stored in **tables**, similar to grids:
- **Columns** define the type of data (e.g., name, age).
- **Rows** represent individual records (e.g., a student named Alice).

Each table usually represents one entity, such as *Students* or *Orders*.

## Example
**Students Table**

| id | name   | age | gpa |
|----|--------|-----|-----|
| 1  | Alice  | 20  | 3.8 |
| 2  | Bob    | 22  | 3.2 |

## Practice Questions
1. What is the difference between a row and a column in a table?
2. Represent your favorite appâ€™s data in table form (e.g., Movies on Netflix).

## Key Takeaways
Tables organize data into rows (records) and columns (fields). This structure makes relational databases powerful and easy to query.
