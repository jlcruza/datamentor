# Lesson 3: Database Management Systems (DBMS): Purpose and Types

## Learning Objectives
- Define DBMS and its role in managing data.
- Identify common DBMS software.
- Differentiate between relational and non-relational DBMS.

## Explanation
A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that enables users to create, read, update, and delete data in a database. It ensures data consistency, security, and reliability. DBMSs are broadly categorized into:
- **Relational DBMS (RDBMS):** Use structured tables (e.g., Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- **Non-relational DBMS (NoSQL):** Handle flexible or unstructured data (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).

## Example
- **Relational:** Banking systems using tables for accounts and transactions.
- **NoSQL:** Social networks storing user interactions and feeds.

## Practice Questions
1. What is the role of a DBMS in data management?
2. Name two examples of RDBMS and two of NoSQL systems.

## Key Takeaways
A DBMS is the software layer that makes databases usable. It provides structure, security, and tools for managing data.
