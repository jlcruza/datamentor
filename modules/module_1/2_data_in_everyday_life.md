# Lesson 2: Data in Everyday Life: From Spreadsheets to Databases

## Learning Objectives
- Compare spreadsheets and databases.
- Understand the limitations of spreadsheets when handling complex data.
- Recognize when to use a database instead of a spreadsheet.

## Explanation
Spreadsheets (like Excel) can act like small databases, but they are limited. For example, they donâ€™t enforce strong relationships between tables, and handling large volumes of data becomes inefficient. Databases, on the other hand, are designed for relationships, scalability, and secure data handling.

## Example
Imagine a school system:
- **Spreadsheet**: One sheet listing students, subjects, and grades.
- **Database**: Multiple related tables (Students, Subjects, Grades) linked by keys.

## Practice Questions
1. List two similarities and two differences between spreadsheets and databases.
2. Why might a school prefer a database over spreadsheets?

## Key Takeaways
Spreadsheets are useful for simple data, but databases excel at managing complex, related, and large-scale information.
