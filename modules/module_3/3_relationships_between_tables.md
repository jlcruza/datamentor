# Lesson 3: Relationships Between Tables

## Learning Objectives
- Understand one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.
- Learn how relationships are implemented in relational databases.
- Recognize the importance of foreign keys.

## Explanation
Relationships describe how entities connect to each other:
- **One-to-One (1:1):** One student has one ID card.
- **One-to-Many (1:N):** One teacher teaches many courses.
- **Many-to-Many (M:N):** Students enroll in many courses, and each course has many students.

These relationships are implemented with **foreign keys**.

## Example
- *Students* and *Courses* connected through an *Enrollments* table for a many-to-many relationship.

## Practice Questions
1. Give an example of a 1:1, 1:N, and M:N relationship from daily life.
2. Why do many-to-many relationships often require an extra table?

## Key Takeaways
Relationships define how entities connect, ensuring data is structured logically and consistently.
