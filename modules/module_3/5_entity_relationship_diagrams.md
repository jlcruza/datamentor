# Lesson 5: Entity–Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the purpose of ERDs.
- Interpret basic ERD symbols.
- Draw simple ERDs to represent entities and relationships.

## Explanation
An **Entity–Relationship Diagram (ERD)** visually represents entities, attributes, and their relationships. They help in planning and communicating database design before implementation.

## Example
- Entity boxes = tables (e.g., Student, Course)
- Lines = relationships (1:1, 1:N, M:N)

## Practice Questions
1. Draw an ERD for a library system (Books, Authors, Members, Loans).
2. Explain how ERDs make database design clearer.

## Key Takeaways
ERDs are a blueprint for database design, making complex relationships easier to understand.
