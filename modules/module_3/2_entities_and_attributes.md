# Lesson 2: Entities and Attributes

## Learning Objectives
- Define entities and attributes.
- Distinguish between entities (tables) and attributes (columns).
- Relate entities to real-world concepts.

## Explanation
An **entity** represents a real-world object, such as *Student* or *Course*. **Attributes** describe the properties of that entity, such as a studentâ€™s *name*, *age*, or *GPA*.

In relational databases, entities are represented as tables, and attributes as columns.

## Example
Entity: **Student**  
Attributes: `id`, `name`, `email`, `gpa`

## Practice Questions
1. Identify an entity and at least three attributes for an online shopping app.
2. In a library system, what entities might you define?

## Key Takeaways
Entities are the main objects in the database, and attributes describe their properties.
